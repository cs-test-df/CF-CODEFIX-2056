First, you must declare a variable of the class type. This variable does not define an object.
Instead, it is simply a variable that can refer to an object. Second, you must acquire an actual,
physical copy of the object and assign it to that variable. You can do this using the new
operator. The new operator dynamically allocates (that is, allocates at run time) memory
for an object and returns a reference to it.  **************/
